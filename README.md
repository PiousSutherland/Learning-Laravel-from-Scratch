# Learning Laravel
### This is my proof that I learned Laravel using [this course](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/) by Laracasts[^1]
[^1]: My account can be found [here](https://laracasts.com/@Capacious_Mind)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is <sub>mostly</sub> intended for ~~proof of not ***entirely*** wasting my time~~ building a portfolio :+1:

To quote from the course:
> In this series, we'll use the common desire for a blog - with categories, tags, comments, email notifications, and more.


To do:
- [x] Initialise (finally :tada:)
- [ ] \(Optional) Upload db
- [ ] Commits as they happen

> [!NOTE]
> I uploaded after about lesson 20, so there are a lot of "progress commits" skipped.
