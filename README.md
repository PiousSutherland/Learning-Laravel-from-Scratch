# Learning Laravel
### This is proof I learned Laravel using [this course](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/) by Laracasts[^1]
[^1]: My account can be found [here](https://laracasts.com/@Capacious_Mind)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This was part of the internship at ICTGlobe :+1:

To quote from the course:
> In this series, we'll use the common desire for a blog - with categories, tags, comments, email notifications, and more.
