# Learning Laravel
### This is my proof that I learned Laravel using this [Laracasts course](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/)[^1]





I uploaded after about lesson 20, so there is a lot of "progress commits" skipped.

To quote from the course:
> In this series, we'll use the common desire for a blog - with categories, tags, comments, email notifications, and more.

This is <sub>mostly</sub> intended for proof of ~~not entirely wasting my time~~ building a portfolio.
